# AQSA7 — Engineering Build Plan & Continuity Ledger

Status: ACTIVE
Last updated: 2026-10-08
Owner: Project technical/design lead (ChatGPT)
Repository: Alssaedy50/AQSA7
Umbrella product target: AQSA7

## Mission

Transform the current ALSSAEDY CLINIC receipt application into a clean, reliable, reusable Dental Clinic product that can live inside the AQSA7 umbrella platform and later be configured/sold to other clinics.

## Non-negotiable engineering rules

1. Understand before modifying.
2. Fix root causes, not symptoms.
3. One responsibility has one authoritative implementation.
4. One data domain has one source of truth.
5. No dead/legacy code without a documented reason.
6. No duplicate UI paths or competing state machines.
7. Preserve existing features unless explicitly replaced by a superior, tested implementation.
8. Every architectural change requires regression testing.
9. Never release an unverified build.
10. Update this ledger after every completed phase/task.

## Task Completion, GitHub Record & Handoff Rule

At the end of every task, subtask, phase, or verified work unit:
1. Update GitHub to the complete current state, including implementation result, verification, commits, blockers and decisions.
2. Consolidate or remove obsolete intermediate notes so project documentation contains the current authoritative state without contradictions or unnecessary history.
3. Produce a concise final task report in the conversation: what was completed, current state, exact next step, and who executes it (AI or User).
4. If User input is genuinely required, ask directly and state exactly what is needed and why; do so only after exhausting all reasonable tools, technical paths and verification methods available to AI.
5. Never claim completion without satisfying the defined exit criteria. If verification is unavailable, record the task as PENDING/BLOCKED/UNVERIFIED with the exact reason.
6. GitHub remains the authoritative project state; the conversation handoff must not contradict it.

## Strict 100% Free & Local-First Architectural Constraint

This is a mandatory architectural constraint for AQSA7 and every product inside it.

1. **No paid backend infrastructure is required for the core product.**
   - Core functionality must operate without a paid backend service or paid cloud dependency.
   - Any optional online service must have a local/offline-first fallback and must never become a hidden requirement for core clinic operation.

2. **Persistence**
   - Client-side **IndexedDB is the single durable application database** for clinic data.
   - localStorage may only be used for explicitly scoped UI preferences, temporary draft/recovery state, migration compatibility, or similarly non-authoritative concerns.
   - No second persistent database may be introduced for the same domain.

3. **Assets & hosting**
   - Prefer local/static assets and free static hosting.
   - Avoid heavy remote runtime dependencies unless justified.
   - Hosting must not be required for local clinic data persistence or core receipt operation.

4. **Export & print**
   - Native browser/WebView print is the authoritative PDF/print engine.
   - Preserve A4, A5 and 80mm contracts.
   - No paid/cloud PDF conversion.

5. **Data protection / backup**
   - AQSA7 must provide scheduled local encrypted JSON backup.
   - Backup/restore integrity, encryption design and scheduling are mandatory reliability work before release.

## Cloud Backup & Provider Abstraction — Mandatory Architecture

Cloud backup is an **optional disaster-recovery layer**, not the primary database and not a mandatory requirement for operating AQSA7.

### 1. Local-first authority
- IndexedDB remains the single authoritative durable application database.
- The application must remain fully usable offline without any cloud account.
- Cloud backup/sync must never replace IndexedDB or introduce a second authoritative clinic database.
- Cloud outages, expired free quotas, unavailable networks or provider API changes must not prevent core clinic operation.

### 2. Encrypted backup model
- Cloud uploads must contain an encrypted backup artifact rather than exposed patient/clinic JSON.
- Patient and clinic data must be encrypted before leaving the device.
- Encryption/decryption and backup integrity must be designed, implemented and verified before release.
- Restore must verify integrity before replacing or merging local data.
- The encryption key/password must never be stored inside the cloud backup artifact.

### 3. Provider abstraction
AQSA7 must implement a generic **Backup Provider / Cloud Provider Adapter** boundary.

The backup engine owns:
- backup serialization
- compression where useful
- encryption
- integrity/version metadata
- scheduling
- retention/version policy
- restore validation

Provider adapters own only:
- authentication/authorization with the provider
- upload
- download
- listing/version lookup
- deletion where supported

Provider adapters must not contain clinic business logic, duplicate the repository, or become competing data stores.

### 4. Initial provider and future providers
The first planned user-selectable provider is **Google Drive**, using the customer's own account and OAuth authorization.

The architecture must allow later providers without rebuilding the backup engine:
- Google Drive — first provider
- Microsoft OneDrive — planned alternative
- Dropbox — planned alternative
- AQSA7/self-hosted or other compatible provider — future option if economically and technically justified

The provider list is extensible; no provider is allowed to become a hidden core dependency.

### 5. Free-first requirement
- The cloud-backup feature must be usable with free consumer storage where the provider permits it.
- AQSA7 must not require a paid subscription for core clinic operation.
- The UI must clearly distinguish **free provider limits** from AQSA7 requirements.
- If a free quota is exceeded, the application must warn the user and continue local operation; it must never silently lose or delete local data.
- No claim of “free forever” may be made for an external provider.

### 6. User-controlled connection
Settings must eventually provide a clear flow similar to:
- Cloud Backup: Disabled / Enabled
- Provider: Google Drive / other supported providers
- Connect / Disconnect account
- Last successful backup
- Backup status/error
- Backup Now
- Restore Backup
- Export encrypted backup locally

OAuth tokens/credentials must be handled through the provider's supported authorization flow and must not be hardcoded into the application or committed to GitHub.

### 7. Backup scheduling and reliability
The final product must support:
- automatic scheduled backup/trigger where the platform permits
- retry after temporary network failure
- visible last-success timestamp
- pending/failed backup status
- manual Backup Now
- manual Restore
- safe restore with validation and conflict handling
- local encrypted backup fallback

The system must never report a cloud backup as successful unless the provider confirms the upload and the backup artifact passes local integrity validation.

### 8. Recovery scenarios
Phase 4/5 must explicitly verify:
- phone lost/damaged → install/open AQSA7 on another device → authenticate to the chosen provider → discover backup → verify → restore
- browser storage cleared → restore from encrypted local/cloud backup
- no internet → clinic continues from IndexedDB
- cloud provider unavailable → clinic continues locally
- free cloud quota exceeded → local operation continues and user receives a clear warning
- corrupted/incomplete backup → restore is rejected without destructive replacement

### 9. Security and privacy boundary
- Cloud backup is a transport/storage destination, not a place where raw patient records should be exposed.
- Provider OAuth permissions must be scoped as narrowly as technically possible.
- Credentials/tokens are secrets and must never be placed in public client code, GitHub, or backup artifacts.
- Tenant/clinic isolation and any server-side sync authorization remain Phase 4 concerns for multi-clinic/cloud sync.

### 10. Cross-platform behavior
The same shared backup engine must be used by Web/PWA/Desktop browser and Android.
Only unavoidable platform capabilities may use thin adapters, such as:
- secure/local file access
- native share
- background scheduling
- Android-specific file/notification APIs

No platform-specific backup implementation may become a second business/data path.

### 11. Recommended resilience model
AQSA7 should follow a practical 3-layer protection model:
1. **IndexedDB:** live authoritative local data.
2. **Encrypted local backup:** user-controlled recovery copy.
3. **Encrypted cloud backup:** optional off-device disaster recovery.

This is the target model; it does not make a cloud provider mandatory for core operation.

## Target architecture

AQSA7
- CORE
  - App Shell
  - Router / Navigation
  - Shared UI
  - Theme
  - Storage / Data layer
  - Backup engine
  - Backup provider adapters
  - Export engine
  - Notifications
  - Shared utilities
- PRODUCTS
  - Dental Clinic
    - reusable product
    - ALSSAEDY CLINIC = configured instance
  - future products

## Cross-Platform Product Architecture — Mandatory Constraint

AQSA7 is a **single cross-platform application**, not separate products that are independently rebuilt for Web, Desktop and Android.

1. One shared application core.
2. Same application as responsive Web App/PWA in mobile and desktop browsers and Android wrapper.
3. Build once; core feature changes must not require separate business-logic implementations.
4. Platform adapters only where technically necessary.
5. Phase 2 screens/components are responsive for phone, tablet and desktop from first implementation.
6. Supported clients use the same data contracts, validation, receipt behavior and state model.
7. No platform-specific rebuild of core product features.
8. Phase 5 verifies the shared product across browser/PWA, desktop browser and Android.

**Architecture objective: Build once → share the core → adapt only the platform boundary → run Web/PWA/Desktop/Android without rebuilding the product.**

## Program phases

### Phase 0 — Deep Audit
Status: COMPLETE

### Phase 1 — Architecture Cleanup
Status: COMPLETE

### Phase 2 — UX/UI Reconstruction
Status: IN PROGRESS

Current next task:
- **Task 2.6 — History / Receipts Ledger reconstruction**
- Executor: **AI / Technical Lead**

Completed Phase 2 tasks:
- 2.1 Design System Foundation — COMPLETE
- 2.2 Top App Shell & Navigation Dock — COMPLETE
- 2.3 Patient Directory / Ledger Table — COMPLETE
- 2.4 Patient Account Detail — COMPLETE
- 2.5 Receipt Issuance Panel — COMPLETE

### Phase 2 / Task 2.5 — Receipt Issuance Panel Reconstruction: COMPLETE

Implementation:
- Added a dedicated no-print Receipt Issuance Panel above the protected receipt paper.
- Added live patient context, selected-service count/list, receipt number/date, financial summary and payment/reference status.
- Added primary save, preview, print/PDF and share actions using the existing authoritative handlers.
- Kept all actual receipt inputs inside the existing receipt DOM; the panel is a read/command surface, not a second input or persistence state.
- Added the authoritative live calculateLedger() path and connected it to the issuance summary.
- Connected payment-method and service-selection changes to the same live summary.
- Applied Phase 2 design tokens, responsive mobile behavior and the 44px interaction contract.
- Preserved IndexedDB/repository ownership and protected A5/A4/80mm print/export geometry.

Files:
- index.html
- js/storage.js
- js/app.js
- js/ui.js
- css/templates.css
- .github/workflows/runtime-smoke.yml

Verification:
- AQSA7 Runtime Smoke 37712304937 — PASS on final application checkpoint 5cd3fa26edf1b549b7739a1c7ae20ac26bec4919.
- Android APK 37712305064 — SUCCESS on the same application checkpoint.
- GitHub Pages build 37712304503 — build job SUCCESS; deployment job was still processing when recorded.
- Receipt image export 37712304962 — FAIL in the known pre-existing PDF selectable-text assertion after PDF generation; unrelated to Task 2.5.

Exit decision:
- Task 2.5 functional/design criteria: MET.
- Browser runtime gate: PASS.
- Android build: PASS.
- Pages build: PASS.
- Phase 2 remains IN PROGRESS.

Known release/regression blocker:
- Existing receipt image/PDF verification has a pre-existing PDF selectable-text assertion failure after PDF generation. This remains unresolved and must be cleared before Phase 2/full regression/release exit.

### Phase 3 — Productization
- Separate reusable Dental Clinic product from clinic configuration.
- Clinic profile/configuration model.
- Product defaults.
- Tenant/clinic identity boundaries.
- Prepare for future sellable instances.
